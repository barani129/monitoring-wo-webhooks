# monitoring
Custom resource approach to monitor containers that are terminated with non-zero exit code and reachability of target IP/FQDN on a particular port in a single image.

## Description
Custom resource approach to monitor containers that are terminated with non-zero exit code and reachability of target IP/FQDN on a particular port in a single image and notifies the end user and optionally can notify the remote systems.

After the CRD installation, please execute the following command to under each field in the spec.
```sh
kubectl/oc explain containerscans.monitoring.spark.co.nz
kubectl/oc explain portscans.monitoring.spark.co.nz
kubectl/oc explain vmscans.monitoring.spark.co.nz
kubectl/oc explain metallbscanis.monitoring.spark.co.nz
```
vmscan CRD is for reporting if more than one VM is running on the same host, this may not be much useful to others, but installing the CRD is required to avoid errors in the controller deployment logs.

## Deployment
Sample deployment
1. Create the CRDs
```sh
oc create -f monitoring-wo-webhooks/config/crd/bases/monitoring.spark.co.nz_containerscans.yaml
oc create -f monitoring-wo-webhooks/config/crd/bases/monitoring.spark.co.nz_portscans.yaml
oc create -f monitoring-wo-webhooks/config/crd/bases/monitoring.spark.co.nz_vmscans.yaml
oc create -f monitoring-wo-webhooks/config/crd/bases/monitoring.spark.co.nz_metallbscans.yaml
```
2. Create the service account
```sh
oc project <yourproject>
oc create sa <sa>
```
3. Create roles/rolebindings for service account
Modify service account name in role_binding.yaml
```sh
oc create -f monitoring-wo-webhooks/config/rbac/role.yaml
oc create -f monitoring-wo-webhooks/config/rbac/role_binding.yaml
```
4. Create the deployment of the controller
update the created service account and image name in the deployment file
```sh
oc create deployment -f <deployment.yaml>
```
5. To run as non-root user
update security context, runAsUser and runAsGroup if required.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/container-scan:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/container-scan:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/container-scan:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/container-scan/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```
